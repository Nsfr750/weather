## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nsfr750/weather.git
   cd weather
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended)**

   Windows:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   
   Linux/macOS:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up OpenWeatherMap API Key (Required for Weather Maps)**

   The weather maps feature requires an API key from OpenWeatherMap. You can get a free API key by signing up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api). The free tier includes 1,000,000 calls/month which is more than enough for personal use.

   After obtaining your API key, run the setup script:

   ```bash
   python script/setup_owm_api.py
   ```

   Follow the prompts to enter your API key. The key will be securely stored in the application's configuration.

5. **Install additional dependencies for weather maps (optional)**
   
   The weather maps feature requires these additional packages:
   
   ```bash
   pip install folium PyQtWebEngine geopy
   ```
   
   - `folium`: For creating interactive maps
   - `PyQtWebEngine`: For displaying web content in the PyQt6 application
   - `geopy`: For geocoding location names to coordinates

4. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   python -m script.main
   ```

### Configuration

1. Launch the application
2. Search for your location to get started
3. No API key required - uses Open-Meteo by default
