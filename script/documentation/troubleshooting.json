Application Won't Start\n\n**Symptoms**:\n- The application crashes immediately after launch\n- You see an error message about missing dependencies\n- The application window doesn't appear\n\n**Solutions**:\n1. **Check System Requirements**:\n   - Ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed\n   - Verify all system dependencies are installed\n   - Check disk space and permissions\n\n2. **Reinstall Dependencies**:\n   ```bash\n   # Activate your virtual environment first\n   pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. **Check for Conflicting Software**:\n   - Temporarily disable antivirus/firewall\n   - Close other applications that might be conflicting\n\n4. **Reset Configuration**:\n   ```bash\n   # Backup your config first\n   mv ~/.config/WeatherApp/config.ini ~/.config/WeatherApp/config.ini.bak\n   ```\n\n### 2. No Weather Data Displayed\n\n**Symptoms**:\n- The app opens but shows \"No data available\"\n- Weather information doesn't update\n- Location cannot be found\n\n**Solutions**:\n1. **Check Internet Connection**:\n   - Verify your device is connected to the internet\n   - Try accessing a website in your browser\n\n2. **Verify API Keys**:\n   - Check if your API key is valid and not expired\n   - Ensure the API key has the correct permissions\n   - Try regenerating the API key\n\n3. **Provider Status**:\n   - Check if the weather service is experiencing outages\n   - Try switching to a different weather provider\n\n4. **Location Services**:\n   - Ensure location services are enabled\n   - Try entering the location manually\n\n### 3. High CPU or Memory Usage\n\n**Symptoms**:\n- The app becomes slow or unresponsive\n- Your computer's fan runs loudly\n- Other applications become slow\n\n**Solutions**:\n1. **Reduce Update Frequency**:\n   - Increase the update interval in Settings > Weather\n   - Disable automatic location updates if not needed\n\n2. **Disable Animations**:\n   - Go to Settings > Display\n   - Toggle off \"Enable animations\"\n\n3. **Clear Cache**:\n   ```bash\n   # Linux/macOS\n   rm -rf ~/.cache/WeatherApp\n   \n   # Windows\n   rmdir /s /q %LOCALAPPDATA%\\WeatherApp\\Cache\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Memory Leaks**:\n   - Monitor memory usage in Task Manager\n   - Report any consistent memory growth\n\n## Log Files\n\nLog files contain detailed information about application events and errors. They are essential for troubleshooting.\n\n### Log Locations\n\n- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.local/share/WeatherApp/logs/`\n- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\\WeatherApp\\logs\\`\n- **macOS**: `~/Library/Logs/WeatherApp/`\n\n### Log Levels\n\n- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for debugging\n- **INFO**: General application events\n- **WARNING**: Potentially harmful situations\n- **ERROR**: Errors that might still allow the app to continue\n- **CRITICAL**: Severe errors that cause the app to crash\n\n### Viewing Logs\n\n1. **From the Application**:\n   - Go to Help > View Logs\n   - Filter by log level\n   - Search for specific terms\n\n2. **From Command Line**:\n   ```bash\n   # Linux/macOS\n   tail -f ~/.local/share/WeatherApp/logs/app.log\n   \n   # Windows\n   Get-Content -Path \"$env:APPDATA\\WeatherApp\\logs\\app.log\" -Wait\n   ```\n\n## Debugging\n\n### Enabling Debug Mode\n\n1. **From Command Line**:\n   ```bash\n   python -m script.main --debug\n   ```\n\n2. **From Configuration**:\n   ```ini\n   [Logging]\n   level = DEBUG\n   ```\n\n### Common Error Messages\n\n#### \"API Rate Limit Exceeded\"\n- **Cause**: Too many requests to the weather API\n- **Solution**:\n  - Wait before making more requests\n  - Upgrade your API plan if needed\n  - Implement proper caching\n\n#### \"Invalid API Key\"\n- **Cause**: The provided API key is invalid or expired\n- **Solution**:\n  - Verify the key is correct\n  - Check for extra spaces\n  - Generate a new key if needed\n\n#### \"Location Not Found\"\n- **Cause**: The specified location doesn't exist\n- **Solution**:\n  - Check for typos\n  - Try a nearby larger city\n  - Use coordinates instead of city name\n\n### Using a Debugger\n\n1. **VS Code**:\n   - Set breakpoints in your code\n   - Press F5 to start debugging\n   - Use the debug console to inspect variables\n\n2. **pdb (Python Debugger)**:\n   ```python\n   import pdb; pdb.set_trace()  # Add this line where you want to break\n   ```\n\n## Performance Issues\n\n### Slow Startup\n\n1. **Disable Unnecessary Plugins**:\n   - Check for third-party plugins\n   - Disable unused providers\n\n2. **Optimize Imports**:\n   - Use lazy loading for heavy modules\n   - Remove unused imports\n\n### High Memory Usage\n\n1. **Check for Memory Leaks**:\n   - Monitor memory usage over time\n   - Look for objects that aren't being garbage collected\n\n2. **Reduce Cache Size**:\n   ```ini\n   [Cache]\n   max_size = 100  # MB\n   ```\n\n### Network Issues\n\n1. **Check Connection**:\n   ```bash\n   ping api.openweathermap.org\n   ```\n\n2. **Proxy Settings**:\n   - Configure proxy in Settings > Network\n   - Check firewall settings\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Q: How do I update the application?\nA: Use your package manager or download the latest version from GitHub.\n\n### Q: Why is the weather data not updating?\nA: Check your internet connection and API key. The app caches data to reduce API calls.\n\n### Q: How do I change the temperature unit?\nA: Go to Settings > Display > Units and select your preferred unit.\n\n### Q: The app is using too much battery. What can I do?\nA: Reduce the update frequency and disable unnecessary features like animations.\n\n### Q: How do I report a bug?\nA: Please open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Nsfr750/weather/issues) with detailed steps to reproduce the issue.\n\n## Getting Help\n\nIf you've tried the solutions above and are still experiencing issues:\n\n1. **Check the Documentation**:\n   - [User Guide](usage.md)\n   - [Configuration](configuration.md)\n   - [API Documentation](api.md)\n\n2. **Search Existing Issues**:\n   - [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Nsfr750/weather/issues)\n   - [FAQ](https://github.com/Nsfr750/weather/wiki/FAQ)\n\n3. **Ask the Community**:\n   - [Discord](https://discord.gg/ryqNeuRYjD)\n   - [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Nsfr750/weather/discussions)\n\n4. **Contact Support**:\n   - Email: nsfr750@yandex.com\n   - Include your system information and error logs\n\n### When Reporting an Issue\n\nPlease include the following information:\n1. Weather App version\n2. Operating System and version\n3. Steps to reproduce the issue\n4. Expected vs. actual behavior\n5. Relevant error messages or logs\n6. Screenshots if applicable\n\n## Emergency Recovery\n\nIf the application becomes completely unresponsive:\n\n1. **Force Quit**:\n   - Windows: Ctrl+Alt+Delete → Task Manager → End Task\n   - macOS: Command+Option+Esc → Force Quit\n   - Linux: `pkill -f weather`\n\n2. **Reset Configuration**:\n   ```bash\n   # Linux/macOS\n   rm -rf ~/.config/WeatherApp\n   \n   # Windows\n   rmdir /s /q %APPDATA%\\WeatherApp\n   ```\n\n3. **Reinstall**:\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall weather-app\n   pip install --no-cache-dir weather-app\n   ```\n\nRemember to back up your configuration before making any changes!\n",
